Node.js -> JS Runtime

JS uded in browser -> manipulates the DOM [interact with the page] - whatever we see

Node.js -> built on JS -> takes JS and puts it in diff env. -> server [just like normal programs in our computer or any other computer]

Node.js -> we can use to run outside the browser

Normal programs in our computer or other computer anywhere.

Node.js -> uses V8 (JS engine Google Chrome) <- compiles JS
v8 -> compiles to Machine Code (JS code to Machine Code)

Node.js adds more features like accessing file system (reading or writing files or so on.) (which is not possible in browser)

In a nutshell, allows JS on your computer and it adds useful functionalities to JS engine.

Installing Node.js and creating app

In a nutshell, Node.js is JS on server.

User -> Client (browser) (written in HTML, CSS and JS) -> reqeust some resourese to some server (typing on a url) and the response is received in HTML, CSS or JS files.

Server handles business logic, Input Validation, DB Auth, etc. User can't see all these things which is happening behind the scenes.


We need Node.js here to write code on server.

So to summarize, Node.js is a JS Runtime

which you can use it for more than just server side code, it can be used to  create utlity scripts, build tools.


Roles -> Node.js (used for Web Development)

1. Run Server

create server and listen to incoming requests.

2. Business logic:

handle requests, validate input, connect to DB

3. Responses.

return responses. (rendered html, json)

We can use Node in REPL mode or using Files.
